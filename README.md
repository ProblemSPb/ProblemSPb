## Hi there, I'm Elena 👋👩🏼‍💻

I am a self-taught developer. Yeah, I'm guilty too. 😃

After two years of practicing and learning how to code in my spare time, I finally changed my job and now I'm bringing technologies to HR world.
By my example, I want to support everyone out there who are already teaching themselves how to code or are considering it. 

I know it's a beginning, but...
